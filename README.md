# PerfectColorSwitchingInterface (PCSI for short)

This was born due to my frustrations with changing colors in a picture using the bucket tool : There is no tolerance for color gradients making it an absolute pain, and replacing by a flat color erases many gradients and interesting features. This tool instead allows you to select a range of colors to be replaced and keeps the brightness differences of replaced colors, making it much cleaner

## Requirements
```
Python 3.6 or higher
Pillow (for image processing)
tkinter (for GUI)
```

## Installation

Install Python if you don't have it installed already.
Install required dependencies using pip:
```
pip install pillow
```

## Usage 
- Clone or download this repository to your computer.
- Open the terminal or command prompt.
- Navigate to the directory where the Python file is located.
- Run the following command:`python PerfectColorSwitchingInterface.py`
- Click `Open Image` and select the image you want to work on
- You're ready to go ! You can select the color you want to replace by clicking on the image you opened in the window
